-----------------------------

TclUP was created by Anthony Baldwin / http://tonybaldwin.me

TclUP is crossplatform (will run on any system, including GNU/Linux, Mac, BSD, or Windows, so long as it has the required Tcl packages installed).

------------------

# TclUP requires:

Tcl8.5 or newer

On GNU/Linux systems you can generall install that with your favorite pkg manager (aptitude, yum, etc.)
TclUP will require package ftp.
Once Tcl8.5 is installed do

     $ teacup install ftp

On Windows systems, if you install the ActiveStateTcl, you should be all set.
Get it here:

http://www.activestate.com/

Then you can just click the tclup.tcl file to run it, make a shortcut to it on your desktop, etc.

-----------------------------

For installation on GNU/Linux, untar the tarball (you must have done that to be reading this),
then cd to the untarred dir and do

     :~$ ./install.sh
