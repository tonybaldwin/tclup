TclUP is a quick -n- dirty ftp upload/download tool.

![TclUP](http://tonyb.myownsite.me/images/tclup.20150226.jpg)

-----------------------------

TclUP was created by Anthony Baldwin / http://tonybaldwin.me

------------------

# TclUP requires:

Tcl8.5 or newer

Get it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/

or

We like ActiveTcl-8.6

Get it here:

http://www.activestate.com/

TclUP will require package ftp.
On GNU/Linux systems If you don't have it, once Tcl8.5 is installed do

     $ teacup install ftp

On Windows systems, if you install the ActiveStateTcl, you should be all set.

-----------------------------

For installation, untar the tarball (you must have done that to be reading this),
then cd to the untarred dir and do

     :~$ sudo ./install.sh

-----------------------------

If you have complaints, call 1-800-YO-MOMS.

Be well,
Tony
